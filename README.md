# efood_BI_assessment
This is the work I have done for the interview process for efood

## User guide
1. Before runing the notebook, just make sure that the csv file "orders_Jan21" exists in the working space
2. Run the jupyter notebook
3. After running, a csv file called "cust_final" is saved in the workspace
4. Use "cust_final" to visualise the customer data on a tool of your choice
5. I have used Power BI, and the presentation is saved in the repo
